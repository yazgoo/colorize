Description
===========

Colorize is the most basic tool to reverse engineer binary files.
It allows to load binaries and view them in hexadecimal, floats, short integers, and ascii characters.
It allows to highligt parts of the text via pre-defined styles.
Just click on the style you want to use, then select the text you want to highlight.
For each file name, all your changes are stored on localStorage.
You can clear this storage using "clear".
If you want to backup your work, use the "backup hexa" button.
You can then load it via "load hexa", which will overwrite your localStorage copy.

  *  in colors.css: the styles
